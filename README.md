# ML-Project-DevTown
This project aims to analyse data from a dataset (more specifically, a CSV file) regarding the games released on Steam.
The CSV file contains release information, reviews, and peak players stats of all games that have been released on the platform (i.e., from 2006-2023).
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whigmalwhim/steam-releases.
